## Projects:

##### [Data Science: TrackML Particle Tracking Challenge](https://github.com/ponderersnook/ParticleTracking-CERN-Kaggle)
• Explored CERN’s LHC experiment on particle collision to recreate mini big-bangs. After each collision particles scatter travelling through detectors leaving tracks.  
• Conducted exploratory data analysis of collision data and reconstructed particle trajectories to link each track to one hit on the detector.  


##### [BTech Project: Laser Propulsion of Nanosat to Low Earth Orbit](https://github.com/ponderersnook/BTP) 
• Explored a novel engine-less approach to spacecraft propulsion that mitigates weight constraints.  
• Simulated motion of laser propelled spacecraft on Matlab, by modeling motion equations to conduct parameterized study of
spacecraft motion.  
• Stabilized spacecraft trajectory and minimized path deviations by optimizing parameters.  
• Technologies: Matlab.  

##### [Indian Legal System](https://github.com/ponderersnook/Indian-Legal-System)
• Researched and wrote a concept note on the law making process in India. Presented the topic with a case study poster.  
• Wrote an essay reviewing whether mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility is a good legal provision. Made a poster summarizing the arguments.  
• Team size - 8. 

##### [Introduction to International Relations](https://github.com/ponderersnook/Introduction-to-International-Relations)
• Wrote a thought paper commentating on the changing Indian foreign policy under a new regime.  
• Reviewed a journal article on long term stability of democracies.  
• Presented two different real world issues, discussing their impact on international relations.  
• Created a portfolio website using GitHub Pages.  

##### [Wireless Communication: Molecular Communication via Diffusion](https://github.com/ponderersnook/molecular-communication)
• Explored a novel approach of communication via molecules having wide ranging impact on future applications.  
• Replicated paper that optimized bit error rate of the receiver for an unbounded environment.  
• Using previous result suggested that channel boundaries have no impact on the bit error rate.  
• Technologies: Matlab.  

##### [VLSI Design: Electric VLSI Design](https://github.com/ponderersnook/btech_vlsi_project)
• Implemented a boolean expression using combinational circuits. Simplified the equation and designed its circuit.  
• Designed the schematic and layout diagrams of the circuit on an EDA tool.  
• Wrote test bench on LTSpice and simulated the circuit according to the truth table.  
• Technologies: Electric VLSI Design tool and LTSpice.  

##### Embedded Systems Design: Bluetooth Control Pick and Place Robot
• Built a ’Pick and Place Robot’ arm for remote operation. Selected components for assembly and interfaced them with AtMega32 microcontroller.  
• Commands were sent from an android application to Bluetooth receiver. Decoded commands using C to control motor driver and motors for robot motion.  
• Technologies: C, ATMega32, Robokits.  


##### Computer Organization: 8 bits MIPS Processor
• Designed a RISC based, 5 stage, pipeline architecture processor using Verilog HDL. It implemented 28 instructions in 3 addressing formats.  
• Implemented instructions on a Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA, including arithmetic and logical operations, unconditional and conditional jumps and memory instructions (load/store).  
• Implemented Fetch block, Decode block, Execution Block consisting of ALU, Data Memory Block, WriteBack and Clock control Block.  
• Technologies: Verilog HDL, Xilinx ISE.  

##### Critical Thinking and Argumentation
• How you see the world: Wrote 5 essays on a chosen topic arguing based on critical thinking principles.  
• Media Portfolio: Collaborated in a team of 3 to gather news from various sources on a topic, extract quotes and commentaries, annotate and analyse for facts, opinions, fallacies, value judgments, reasoning and rationalizing.  
• Knowing the world: Collaborated in a team of 3 to interview people on a chosen topic, transcribed and analyzed the interview to identify claims, premises, arguments and assertions. Made general observations based on the analysis.  
• Team size - 3. 

##### Digital Logic Design: 32 bit ALU
• 32 bit ALU made on Xilinx using Verilog, which could perform basic arithmetic and logical operations using 4 bit opcode.  
• The ALU consisted of blocks such as logical block, comparator block, adder-subtractor block, shifter block.  
• Technologies: Verilog HDL, Xilinx ISE, Logisim.  


##### Basic Electric Circuits: Battery Charger
• Designed a circuit that could charge a 12 V Lead Acid battery. • Indicated full and low charge.
• Automatically cutoff once battery is fully charged.
• Technologies: Breadboard
